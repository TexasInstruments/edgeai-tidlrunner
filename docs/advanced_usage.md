## Advanced - Usage of rtwrapper (edgeai_tidlrunner.rtwrapper advanced interface)
Abstractions are sometimes a hindrance to understand what is really happening under the hood or to easily modify and extend. rtwrapper is a thin, low level interface to the core tidl-tools, without much overhead. Use it to understand how the core tidl-tools work or to integrate into your application.
