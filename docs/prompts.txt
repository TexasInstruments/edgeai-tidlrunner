## docs/command_line_arguments.md

Create a markdown file docs/command_line_arguments.md that explains the command line argumetns for these commands under the docs folder in this repository. The sections in the markdown file should be the differnt commands - compile, infer, accuracy, analyze, optimize, extract, report. Don't add any other section in the markdown file - the only sections should be these. Make single table under each section. Not additional descriptions or examples or explanations are needed - only the commandline options need to be placed in compact tables. Do not capitalize the section names - keep the command names as it is.
For example, it is not
## Compile
that I want, but
## compile
If the file already exists, replace it with new file.



## docs/getting_started.md

Create a .md markdown file docs/getting_started.md that helps new users to get started using this repository. Keep the information high level. Give links on how to install and use the repository. For usage, talk about (1) basic command line usage (giving only the model_path as input - that will use random inputs for calibration) (2) config file based usage in which the uer can specify any arguments.
