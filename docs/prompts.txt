## docs/command_line_arguments.md

Create a markdown file docs/command_line_arguments.md that explains the command line argumetns for these commands under the docs folder in this repository. The sections in the markdown file should be the differnt commands - compile, infer, accuracy, analyze, optimize, extract, report. Don't add any other section in the markdown file - the only sections should be these. Make single table under each section. Not additional descriptions or examples or explanations are needed - only the commandline options need to be placed in compact tables. Do not capitalize the section names - keep the command names as it is.
For example, it is not
## Compile
that I want, but
## compile
If the file already exists, replace it with new file.
